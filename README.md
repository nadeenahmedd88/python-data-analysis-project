#  Sentiment Data Analysis Project

##  Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing  Sentiment  data using Python.  
The analysis covers data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), regression analysis, and time series analysis to extract insights about user engagement and sentiment over time.

---

##  Dataset Description
The dataset contains  Sentiment  posts with textual content, sentiment labels, timestamps, and engagement metrics.

### Columns include:
- Text
- Sentiment
- Timestamp
- User
- Platform
- Hashtags
- Retweets
- Likes
- Country
- Year, Month, Day, Hour

---

## Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Loaded the dataset using pandas
- Checked missing values
- Checked duplicate records
- Standardized date and time formats
- Cleaned and prepared categorical variables

---

##  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Calculated summary statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation)
- Visualized data distributions using histograms, boxplots, and scatter plots
- Analyzed engagement metrics such as Likes and Retweets
- Explored correlations between numerical features

---

##  Regression Analysis
- Built a simple linear regression model to predict engagement metrics
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets
- Evaluated the model using R-squared and Mean Squared Error (MSE)

---

##  Time Series Analysis
- Analyzed posting activity and engagement over time
- Identified trends and seasonal patterns
- Applied time series decomposition and moving averages

---

##  Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Statsmodels

---
##  Conclusion
This project demonstrates practical data analysis skills on real-world Sentiment data, from preprocessing to advanced analytical techniques.
