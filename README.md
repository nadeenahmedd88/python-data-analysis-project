## 📂 Dataset Description
The dataset contains  Sentiment  posts with textual content, sentiment labels, timestamps, and engagement metrics.

### Columns include:
- Text
- Sentiment
- Timestamp
- User
- Platform
- Hashtags
- Retweets
- Likes
- Country
- Year, Month, Day, Hour

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Loaded the dataset using pandas
- Checked missing values
- Checked duplicate records
- Standardized date and time formats
- Cleaned and prepared categorical variables

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Calculated summary statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation)
- Visualized data distributions using histograms, boxplots, and scatter plots
- Analyzed engagement metrics such as Likes and Retweets
- Explored correlations between numerical features

---

## 📈 Regression Analysis
- Built a simple linear regression model to predict engagement metrics
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets
- Evaluated the model using R-squared and Mean Squared Error (MSE)

---

## ⏱️ Time Series Analysis
- Analyzed posting activity and engagement over time
- Identified trends and seasonal patterns
- Applied time series decomposition and moving averages

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Statsmodels
